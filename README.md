# Minecraft-Coord-Logger
A Java GUI I created to keep track of Minecraft Coordinates


###Installation
https://github.com/Eric1K/Minecraft-Coord-Logger/blob/main/Eric1K's%20Coord%20editor.jar or download Eric1K's Coord editor.jar
Run the Jar file to start the program.

###Usage
A .storage folder will be created to store your coordinates. You can create multiple instances of this jar per world wherever you'd like (as long as they are in different folders) and they will save.
